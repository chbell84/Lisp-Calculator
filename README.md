# Lisp-Calculator
### This is a simple calculator that takes commands using LISP syntax.

I wrote it to get into the Recurse Center. It started as a general interpreter but I moved on once I got it running as a calculator.

The files are organized as an Eclipse project. There are no external dependancies.

Example input and output:

  (+ 2 3)
  5
  (* (+ 2 3) 8)
