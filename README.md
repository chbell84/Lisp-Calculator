# Lisp-Calculator
<h3>This is a simple calculator that takes commands using LISP syntax.</h3>
<p>I wrote it to get into the Recurse Center. It started as a general interpreter but I moved on once I got it running as a calculator.</p>
<p>The files are organized as an Eclipse project. There are no external dependancies.</p>
<p>Example input and output:</p>
<p><em>(+ 2 3)</em></p>
<p><em>5</em></p>
<p><em>(* (+ 2 3) 8)</em></p>
<p><em>40</em></p>
